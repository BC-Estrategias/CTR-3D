Copy your own NTSC-U retail Crash Team Racing disc image into this folder,
named ctr-u.bin. It must be the raw MODE2/2352 BIN layout (not a cooked
2048-byte ISO), so the XA/STR sectors that audio and FMV need are present.
Nothing playable is included in this download -- you must provide your own
legally-owned disc dump.

CTR 3D ${VERSION_LABEL} for New Nintendo 3DS

A homebrew port of Crash Team Racing (PS1, 1999). CTR 3D is a fork of
CTR Native, the native PC port built on the CTR-ModSDK decompilation.

Requirements:
- New Nintendo 3DS, New 3DS XL, or New 2DS XL only -- the original
  3DS/2DS is not supported.
- Custom firmware with the Homebrew Launcher (Luma3DS).
- One-time DSP firmware dump (Rosalina -> Miscellaneous options ->
  Dump DSP firmware), or audio will be silent.
- Your own NTSC-U retail CTR disc image. Nothing playable is included.

Install:
1. Extract this zip to your SD card root. It mirrors the SD card
   layout, so the game ends up at /3ds/ctr_native/ctr_native.3dsx.
2. Copy your disc image to /3ds/ctr_native/assets/ctr-u.bin -- raw
   MODE2/2352 BIN, not a cooked ISO.
3. Launch "CTR 3D" from the Homebrew Launcher.

Saves are written to /3ds/ctr_native/memcards/, the same files the PC
port uses.

Controls follow the button's position on the PlayStation pad:
  B = accelerate (Cross)      A = use weapon (Circle)
  Y = brake / reverse (Square)   X = map / speedometer (Triangle)
  L, R = hop and power-slide (L1, R1)   START = pause
In menus, A and B confirm; X and Y go back.

Screens: the bottom screen always shows the in-race map. The top screen
starts on the speedometer; X switches it to the map, as Triangle does on
PS1. The 3D slider works in real time.

The main menu has an OPTIONS entry with four toggles: PAL PENTA,
RESERVES METER, BOTTOM MAP, and TEXTURE FILTER. VS and Battle modes are
not offered.

Reporting a bug: create an empty file at
/3ds/ctr_native/enable-log.txt, reproduce the problem, then attach
/ctr3ds.log from the SD card root. Delete enable-log.txt afterwards --
logging costs a small stutter every couple of seconds.
