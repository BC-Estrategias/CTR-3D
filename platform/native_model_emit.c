 * ---------------------------------------------------------------- [MDLDEPTH]

 * Depth self-check. Answers one question and nothing else: is the view.z this

 * vertex?
 *
 * It can be exact rather than approximate because of where the capture sits.
 * NativeModelEmit_Triangle runs immediately after RenderBucket_ProjectPrim_
 * Normal, so SZ1/SZ2/SZ3 still hold the hardware's projected depth for
 * tempPacked[1]/[2]/[3] -- the very three vertices being captured. RTPT writes

 * SZ1/SZ2 for the reuse case (:2678), so the correspondence holds on both
 * paths. That makes this a comparison against ground truth, not against a
 * second derivation of the same guess.
 *
 * Why it exists: the player kart sinks into the road under dmodel, and the
 * model path is now the only thing drawing it (state 1), computing depth from
 * its own instance matrix with no lookup table anywhere near it. Either that
 * computation disagrees with the GTE -- in which case the fault is here and
 * this line says so with a number -- or it agrees, and the disagreement is on
 * the ROAD's side. s29b already ruled a height offset out by reading; this
 * rules the model side in or out by measuring.
 *
 * Comparison is done in integer, in the GTE's own shape: MAC3 = TRZ*4096 +
 * R2.v, SZ3 = clamp(MAC3 >> 12, 0, 65535) (native_gte_core.c's Lm_D). The
