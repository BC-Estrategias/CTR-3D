// A collision or a stale (last frame's) entry is always a miss, never a wrong
// value -- callers fall back to today's exact snapped behavior on a miss.
//
// DOUBLE-BUFFERED: the game thread writes frame N+1's captures while the
// walk worker may still be reading frame N's table. Two buffers;
// MainFrame_ResetDB's GTECapture_Clear() is the flip point, and DrawOTag
// publishes the write buffer as the walk's read buffer at post time. One
// walk in flight ever (the game's own DrawSync fence), so a flipped-back
// buffer can never still be held by a walk. PC's synchronous walk reads the
// buffer it just wrote (publish makes read==write), byte-identical to
// single-buffered behavior.
//
// Sizing: eviction misses are not free visually -- on a STATIC scene (menus),
// a vertex that hits most frames but is evicted on some frames pops by up to
// 1px on exactly those frames. PC stays at 2^18 entries (4 MiB/buffer). The
// 3DS -- which consumes this table for the retained-geometry full form, not
// desnap -- takes 2^16 (1.5 MiB/buffer): there an eviction only downgrades a
// prim from retained to walked for a frame, invisible by construction.

 *   - OCCLUSION: an exempt primitive resolves exactly as if its stores had
 *     been suppressed -- a miss. That is retail's own painter's statement:
 *     the flag paints over everything during a
 *     screen-covering wipe (its packets are in the UI band there) and sits
 *     behind the menu models when parked (bucket-derived far depth). Pose
 *     changes are retail draw order, not a stereo jump.
 *   - PARALLAX: the same primitive's captures ARE read, and they carry the
 *     compressed ripple band the store-side remap wrote, in every pose,
 *     continuously. This is the channel the owner's no-pose-conditional rule
 *     governs.
