 * Boundary between the game's unity translation unit and libctru.
 *
 * This header deliberately exposes NOTHING from <3ds.h> -- no libctru types,
 * no libctru constants -- and is safe to include from the unity build. That
 * separation is not stylistic. Pulling <3ds.h> into the unity TU collides with
 * the decompilation in three concrete ways:
 *
 *   1. include/psx/r3000.h defines the MIPS assembler aliases `flush` and
 *      `inval`, which mangle libctru's own parameter names (boss.h and nfc.h
 *      both declare parameters called `inval`).
 *   2. libctru typedefs `ThreadFunc` as void(*)(void*); the game already has
 *      its own ThreadFunc taking a struct Thread*.
 *   3. libctru typedefs u8/u32/s32 to the stdint types, which is exactly the
 *      binding include/macros.h has to avoid on ARM (see the note there).
 *
 * n3ds_backend.c is therefore compiled as its own translation unit -- it sees
 * libctru and never sees the game headers. Everything crossing this line uses
 * plain C scalar types.

 * replacement policy (which (page,clut,format) is decoded into which
 * (atlas,cell)) and calls UploadDecodedCell to overwrite one cell's content.
 *
 * Why atlases, not one texture per entry: PC's AddSplit doesn't split by
 * page/clut, so one scene commonly touches many (page,clut) combos in an
 * interleaved triangle stream; citro3d can bind only one texture per draw,
 * so without atlasing every combo change forces a new bind+draw.

 * highest-cells-per-bind, atlas actually obtainable.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: citro3d's C3D_TexLoadImage (which C3D_TexUpload wraps) is a raw
 * memcpy over a WHOLE mip level -- verified directly against citro3d's
 * upstream source -- with no sub-rect upload API at all, so a single cell's

 * Deliberately thinner than the track's API above, because models REUSE the
 * packet path's vertex plumbing rather than owning their own. Model geometry is
 * per-frame dynamic (animation is delta-decoded on the CPU every frame -- see
 * the design's section 3), so there is no resident buffer to upload; it goes
 * through N3DS_C3DAppendVertices like any packet run. And N3DS_Vertex already
 * has exactly the fields a model vertex needs -- position, texcoord, colour --
 * so the packet attribute layout and buffer binding are reused verbatim. The
 * ONLY thing that differs is which vertex program is bound and what its
 * uniforms say, which is what these four calls do.
 *
 * Field reinterpretation, stated because it is the one subtle part: on the
 * packet path N3DS_Vertex.x/y are SCREEN pixels and z is a depth stamp. Here
 * x/y/z are the model-space position the software GTE would have received, and
 * the shader does the projection. Same 14 bytes, same loader, different
 * meaning -- so never mix model and packet vertices in one draw.
 *
 * Bracketing: Begin binds the program and uploads the shared projection;
 * Instance uploads one instance's composed camera rows (see the shader header
 * for the derivation); Run draws one texture-homogeneous span of the vertices
 * appended for that instance; End restores every piece of packet-path state,
