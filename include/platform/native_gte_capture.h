// Per-frame side table of GTE sub-pixel fractions discarded by the >>16 in
// GTE_RotTransPers, keyed by the exact truncated screen coordinate written to
// the primitive packet. See docs/GTE_CAPTURE_DESIGN.md. Declarations are
// always visible; each caller gates its own use behind CTR_NATIVE_GTE_CAPTURE,
// so a flag-off build never emits a call and these never need to be defined.

// Runtime ablation of the capture writes, for measuring what the subsystem
// costs before a feature commits to depending on it. Three states, because the
// two per-vertex calls answer different questions:
//   1 = full capture (NoteMatrix + Store) -- today's compiled-in behavior
//   2 = Store only, no NoteMatrix -- what a depth consumer actually needs
//   0 = neither; every later lookup misses and each consumer takes the exact
//       snapped fallback it already has for collisions and evictions, so 0 is
//       behaviorally today's flag-off build.
// 1-vs-2 prices the matrix-class probe; 2-vs-0 prices the table itself.
// Defined only in CTR_NATIVE_GTE_CAPTURE builds (every caller gates on it).
