// Rung 1 of the PICA-native model renderer (docs/NATIVE_MODEL_RENDERER_DESIGN.md).
//
// The track renderer's equivalent pair is NativeTrackFrame_Record (game thread
// builds a snapshot) and NativeTrackDraw_IssueForWalk (render worker reads it).
// This is the model half of that shape: the game thread captures every model
// triangle it draws, in MODEL SPACE, with its instance's model->view matrix,
// into a double-buffered snapshot of plain scalars. Nothing here draws.
//
// WHERE THE CAPTURE SITS, AND WHY THERE. RenderBucket_DrawFunc_Normal walks a
// model's command list, delta-decodes each vertex, projects each triangle
// through the software GTE, and writes a POLY_GT3. The capture hooks the point
// where that walk has COMMITTED to drawing a triangle -- after projection and
// after the texture lookup succeeded -- so at this rung the captured set is
// exactly the set retail draws, triangle for triangle.
//
// That is deliberate for one rung only. It costs nothing extra (the walk is
// already running and the vertices are already decoded), it makes the capture
// verifiable against the packet path by construction, and the gap between what
// it captures and what native_model_frame.c's [MODELFRAME] reports as the
// topology maximum IS the amount retail's backface/off-screen rejection drops
// -- the number that decides whether the PICA path needs CPU-side culling
// (design section 7). Deleting the projection is rung 4, and moves this call
// about fifteen lines earlier in the same function.

// Runtime toggle, same three-state shape as g_dbg_trackRender:
//   0 = off. No capture, no logging, no cost -- the A/B baseline, which must be
//       indistinguishable from a build with the feature compiled out.
//   1 = native replaces the packet path (rung 4+; at rung 1 it only captures,
//       because there is nothing yet to replace it with).
//   2 = both.
// Defined in platform/native_model_emit.c; only meaningful in
// CTR_NATIVE_MODEL_RENDERER builds.
extern int g_dbg_modelRender;

// Opens capture for one instance and records its model->view matrix and the
// camera terms the projection needs. Returns 0 when capture is inactive (toggle
// off, snapshot full, feature compiled out) -- callers use it to skip the
// per-triangle calls entirely rather than paying a test per triangle.
//
// forceSemiTrans: this instance's primitive WRITER emits semi-transparent
// primitives unconditionally, ignoring its textures (the ghost and depth-fade
// writers do; the normal one classifies by tpage like everything else). The
// caller computes it because the writer identifiers live in game/. Getting it
// wrong in the 0 direction is what made N. Tropy's ghost draw solid.
//
// ghostComposite: this instance uses the GHOST writer at nonzero alphaScale
// (an alpha-zero ghost tail-calls the normal writer, so the caller folds the
// alpha test in). The ghost writer's primitive is a two-packet composite --
// a flat B-F mask of the scratch fade colour under an ABR-1 additive body
// whose colours went through the writer's own gte_dpct -- and the draw side
// reproduces all three legs. Implies forceSemiTrans.
//
// fadeColorWord: the RenderBucket scratch fadeColor word the ghost writer's
// mask packet reads, captured here because only the instance setup callback
// writes it and BeginInstance runs right after that callback. Ignored unless
// ghostComposite.
//
// specularLit: this instance uses one of the two specular writers (KEY_TOKEN /
// LIT_TEXTURE). Those writers build their colour from their own lcir/dpcs on
// the raw rolling colour and never consume LoadPrimColors' dpct, so the fade
// replay must not run for them; the caller also hands Triangle pre-lit colours
// and a per-face blend override for these instances. Computed in game/ for the
// same reason as forceSemiTrans, and by WRITER rather than by testing
// USE_SPECULAR_LIGHT -- instance-flag bits 16-18 are a combo index, and
// GHOST_DRAW_TRANSPARENT sets the same bits.
//
// inst: the instance being drawn, for the [AXISCHK] cross-class depth-axis
// check (its world translation is pushed through matrix_ViewProj -- the TRACK
// renderer's axis -- and compared against mvp.t[2], the axis every per-prim SZ
// this path and the packet stamps inherit). Only read under
// --model-depth-check; may be NULL, which skips the check for this instance.

// packedXY3[i] is that corner's GTE VXY register (VX in the low halfword, VY in
// the high) and packedZ3[i] its VZ register, both already carrying the frame
// origin and retail's <<2 (or <<1 for the interpolated next-frame decoder).
// Taking the GTE's own inputs rather than re-deriving them from the vertex
// stack means the shader is provably fed the same numbers the GTE got.
//
// color3[i] is the rolling per-vertex colour BEFORE gte_dpct's depth cue -- the
// fog is applied by the primitive writer this capture runs ahead of. See the
// implementation note on why that is fine at this rung and what rung 3 does
// about it.
//
// tex may be NULL: retail's explicit untextured path, and a null table entry
// reaches the same writer.
//
// blendOverride: -1 to classify blending from the tpage as always, else the
// BlendMode (0 = opaque, ABR+1 otherwise) the WRITER forces for this face.
// The specular writers pick ABE per SIDE -- the lit front face of an ABR-0
// page is emitted additive, every other side/page opaque -- which no
// tpage-only rule can express.
//
// Returns 1 when the native path has CLAIMED this triangle, so the caller may
// skip its packet write; 0 means "draw it the retail way". Callers must AND this
// with their own replace-mode test rather than assuming a capture implies a
// draw -- the two diverge on snapshot overflow and on semi-transparent textures,
// and treating them as identical silently deleted geometry in both cases. See
