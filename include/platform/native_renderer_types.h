	 * flag is the exception this exists for: retail's own layering wants it
	 * painted over everything mid-wipe and behind the menu models when
	 * parked (a per-pose OCCLUSION answer), while the stereo eye wants its
	 * wave's true relief continuously, in every pose, with no jump (one
	 * fixed PARALLAX band just behind the convergence plane). One depth
	 * field cannot say both; two can.
	 *
	 * Same units and axis as emitOrdinal (nearer = larger), so 3DS biases
	 * both into s16 identically and the vertex shader's d = 32767 - value
	 * inverse works unchanged on it. Appended for the same reason and with
	 * the same PC guarantee as emitOrdinal above: no GL loader fetches it.

 * the ordered-UI pin owns the band, NOT only while the bottom-screen map is
 * routed: it is both the peel key for the bottom panel (that consumer carries
 * the dumpreq 'btmmap' gate itself) and the sprite-class key for the far-edge
 * UV inset that closes the seam between the map sheet's two half-icons on
 * either screen. Producer: PacketDepth_ResolveXY (native_gpu.c); consumers:
 * NativeRenderer_DrawTriangles' UI branch and N3DS_ConvertTriangleVerts
 * (native_renderer_3ds.c). Only ever stamped while the pin owns the band, so
 * every other stamp consumer still sees exactly {band, 0xFFFF}. */

 * re-pins their z/w to the 0xFFFF pin at the ordered-UI append: ordered-UI
 * layering is draw-order-under-EQUAL-depth, and an off-pin stamp there
 * would let earlier-drawn quad rects occlude these sprites. Never stamp
